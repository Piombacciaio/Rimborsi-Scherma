# Compensi scherma

This script helps me automate some of the most tedious work as a computer technician for fencing competitions: making payment documents for all the people involved.

For privacy reasons some files are missing (e.g. `data/JSON/dt.json` and `data/template.pdf`)

The schema for `data/JSON/dt.json` is a list of dictionaries:

```json
[
    {
        "Nome": "John",
        "Cognome": "Doe",
        "DataNascita": "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00+01:00",
        "DataRinnovo": "YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00+01:00",
        "Domicilio": "Address",
        "Localit√†": "PlaceOfResidence",
        "LuogoNascita": "PlaceOfBirth",
        "MaschioFemmina": "false",
        "NumFIS": "xxxxxx",
        "Qualifica": "COMPUTERISTA"
    },
]
```

Values for `LuogoNascita` and `Domicilio` are sometimes Null as they are not mandatory to comunicate

The time stamps in `DataNascita` and `DataRinnovo` aren't used for anything and they are a leftover from the database export that I will probably remove. (ETA: soon.tm)
Same goes for `MaschioFemmina` that is a bool stored as a string

The keys for `data/template.pdf` are saved in `data/keys` so they shoud give an idea of what the document is like

## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
